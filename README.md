Hi there! I'm Yi, a driven and adaptable software engineer with a solid background in developing cutting-edge software. With my background in software engineering and a PMP certification in Agile Project Management, I bring a distinctive approach to software development. I thrive in the fast-paced, constantly-changing field of technology, where I continually explore novel methods and resources for tackling complex challenges. I embrace demanding tasks and unfamiliar environments, which has made me a resilient and independent woman in tech. I firmly believe that challenges are opportunities for growth, fostering strength and courage.
I started my journey into software engineering when I had the chance to create a digital purchase order system using Excel VBA (Macros) in one of my previous roles. To further enhance my skills, I completed courses on platforms like Udemy and Coursera, earning professional certificates and establishing a solid foundation in programming. Seeking to take my abilities to the next level, I joined the App Academy bootcamp, where I sharpened my full-stack web development capabilities.
Prior to my transition to software engineering, I pursued a Master of Science degree in Civil & Environmental Engineering at UC Berkeley. Following my academic journey, I started jobs in the construction industry, taking on the role of a project engineer. This position involved tasks such as cost estimation, project planning, and construction management.
Working in the construction industry, I was able to address multiple complex project issues with my strong problem-solving skills, helping the company avoid financial losses and legal liabilities. With my meticulous attention to detail, I was also able to manage project scopes efficiently, leading to project awards and significant cost savings. These successes resulted in career advancements.
My transition into software engineering was driven by passion for coding and the desire to make a meaningful impact through innovative solutions. I have proficiency in both frontend and backend software development and data analysis. I am proficient in MERN stack, javaScript ES6+, jQuery, python, flask, SqlAlchemy, SQL, Sequelize, as well as UI/UX design implemented by Figma, CSS, and Bootstrap. I am an enthusiastic and approachable individual with perseverance and resilience. I embrace challenges, uncertainties, and a diversity of perspectives. If you're looking for a candidate with a versatile skill set and a dedication to ongoing development, I'm prepared to make an immediate impact from day one.
